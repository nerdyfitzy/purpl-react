An old project created with create react app. nothing much here now its just public
unfinished collection of tools for sneaker resellers in ~2021

Most of the unfinished or newer code is in the `work` branch. It contains:
- Gmail activity bot for easier captchas
- Scanning of user's gmail to find order confirmations and automatically add them to the tool (largely unfinished)
- Creation of phone numbers to use for certain site's phone verification
- Account generation for sites that required accounts for checkout
- Virtual card generation so users could have multiple different cards to bypass "1 per customer" limits
- More miscellanious features that were either starting to be worked on or were left unfinished

This project largely reached EOL as reselling sneakers became unprofitable.
